							<p>In my professional journey, I've had the privilege to engage in diverse roles that have enriched my skill set and
							broadened my perspective.</p>
							<p>As an Academic Tutor & TA at The University of Sydney's School of Computer Science, I've played a pivotal role in
							shaping the learning journey of third-year computer science students. In this capacity, I've facilitated the
							implementation of real-world testing software applications and the application of design patterns to various projects.
							My expertise spans Java Core, Design Pattern, MVC, MVP, JUnit Testing, System Testing, Mockito Testing, and Java UI
							design, among others.</p>
							<p>Transitioning to my role as a Junior Software Developer at SBM Marketing Communication, I've contributed to the
							development and maintenance of software platforms aimed at connecting brands with diverse audiences across multiple
							platforms. My responsibilities included utilizing technologies such as C#, Java, AngularJs, HTML, Dotnet, and Microsoft
							SQL Server Management (MSSQL) for software development, alongside managing documentation and code deployment processes.</p>
							<p>Prior to this, as a Business Development Manager at UAVS-NSW, I led the External Affairs Department, spearheading
							initiatives to foster connections and share experiences among Vietnamese international students. My accomplishments
							included successfully fundraising for key events and establishing partnerships with universities across Australia.</p>
							<p>These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of project management, software
							development methodologies, and stakeholder engagement. I look forward to applying these skills and contributing to
							impactful projects in the future.</p>
